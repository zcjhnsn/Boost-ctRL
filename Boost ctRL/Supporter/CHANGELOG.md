## 1.2
- FAQ sections can now be made grouped by setting "hasDetailPage" to true. If so, the first three FAQ items will be displayed, along a view all button. The text in this button can be localized per JSON as well through the "viewAllText" attribute of the JSON string.
- The JSON parser is more forgiving for any missing parts
- Improved theme color support on dark mode
- Support for multiple contact sections with their own localized titles. You can still use the original contactItems style (however the title of this section is always the same so I would suggest using the new one instead)
- Support for a changelog message that shows up if the user has not viewed it yet. You can also show a button that always links to the changelog if you want.
- Lots of code cleanup
- The support page now shows a loading indicator if the JSON has not been retrieved yet.
