# Supporter - Native In App Support

Thanks for purchasing Supporter. I hope it will help you give better support to your users in an easy way! I hope Supporter will be your apps' biggest supporter! üòç

I've been building out an in app support section for my apps. Fully native, but customisable through an external JSON. Since I noticed a lot of interest in a tool like this, I decided to make it available for others as well!
